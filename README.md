Clima


ðŸ’¡What is Clima?

This is a Weather app developed by me as the final project of the SheCodes Plus using HTML, CSS and JS languages.

I named my weather app as Cima and created the logo below:

Clima is capable of searching for any city in the world and display its current weather as well as 6 days forecast. 
It is composed of a search engine, API integration, wind speed, weather description, weather icons, 6 days forecast, Celsius and Fahrenheit unit conversion for the current weather.
